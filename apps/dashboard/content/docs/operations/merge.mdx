title: Merge videos
---

Merge multiple media files.

```http
POST /merge
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "fileIds": ["string", "string"],
  "outputFormat": "string",
  "mode": "replace" | "append"
}
```

### Technical Details:
- Uses the first file (`fileIds[0]`) as the base, and swaps it with the results
- Mode defaults to `append`
- Automatically detects and matches resolution
- Preserves aspect ratio with padding
- Uses complex filter chain for proper concatenation
- Output encoding:
  - Video: H.264 (libx264) with fast preset, CRF 22
  - Audio: AAC at 192kbps
