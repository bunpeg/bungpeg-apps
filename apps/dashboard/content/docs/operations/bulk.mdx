title: Bulk operations
---

Create multiples of one operation on multiple files.
This can be considered an inverse of the `/chain` endpoint

```http
POST /bulk
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "fileIds": ["string"],
  "operation": {
      "type": "transcode" | "resize-video" | "trim" | "trim-end" | "extract-audio" | "remove-audio" | "extract-thumbnail",
      // Operation-specific parameters
    }
}
```

### Technical Details:
- Operations can be executed parallel as they affect different files
- Progress can be monitored via status endpoint
- It doesn't include the `add-audio` or `merge-media` operations as these use a different payload
